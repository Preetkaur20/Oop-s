//Abstraction - Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
- Used To achieve security (hide certain details and only show the important details of an object).

1. Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
2. Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided/defined by the subclass (inherited from).

abstract class parent {
    abstract public void greet();

    public parent() {
        System.out.println("I am constructor");
    }

    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello This is Preet :)");
    }
}

class child extends parent {
    @Override
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Good Morning");
    }
}

class child1 extends parent {
    @Override
    public void greet() {
        System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
    }
}

public class abstractClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Abstract class
        // parent p = new parent(); -- throws error because obj of abstract class is not
        // possible

        child c = new child();
        c.greet();
    }
}
